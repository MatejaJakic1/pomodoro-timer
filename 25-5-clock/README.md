# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer built using React, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to set up a session and break length, start and stop the timer, and reset it when needed. When the timer finishes, a sound is played to notify the user that it's time to switch between sessions and breaks.

- Start and stop the timer.
- Reset the timer to the default session and break times.
- Visual updates for the timer status (Session or Break).
- Sound notification when the timer reaches 0.
  
## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
